## Prompt
Create some new responses for the demon doll to provide when a question is posed. The answers should be creepy and some of them should reference hell, Satan, or the Apocalypse.

## Answer
Certainly! Here are a few ideas for creepy responses that a demonic doll could provide when a question is posed:

- "I am not at liberty to reveal that information. My master has forbidden it."
- "I am but a humble servant of Hell. My knowledge is limited."
- "The answer to your question lies within the flames of the Abyss. Are you brave enough to seek it out?"
- "I am not bound by the same laws of time and space as you. The future is a dark and twisted place."
- "Satan himself whispers the secrets of the universe in my ear. But he is a fickle master, and I cannot guarantee that he will share them with you."
- "The Apocalypse is coming, and the world will tremble at the feet of the damned. Are you prepared to join us?"

I hope these responses give you some inspiration for creating your own creepy responses for the demonic doll. Remember, you can customize the responses to fit the personality and theme of the doll that you are creating. Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance.
