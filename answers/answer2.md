Prompt: What are some reactions that a demonic doll would have when chatting with a human?

There are many ways that a demonic doll could react when chatting with a human. Here are a few ideas:

The doll could repeat what the human says, either verbatim or with slight variations.
The doll could respond with cryptic or ominous statements, such as "I see things that you cannot" or "I know secrets that you should not."
The doll could make threats or express malevolent intentions, such as "I will make you pay for your mistakes" or "I will bring darkness to your world."
The doll could try to manipulate or deceive the human, saying things like "You can trust me" or "I will make all your problems go away."
The doll could ask questions or try to learn more about the human, such as "What are you afraid of?" or "Why do you do the things you do?"
Of course, these are just a few examples, and you can come up with your own ideas for how a demonic doll might react when chatting with a human. It's up to you to decide how you want the doll to behave and what kind of personality you want it to have.
