## Prompt
How would I make the script know if a question had been asked?

## Answer
To determine if a question has been asked in a conversation, you could use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text of the message. In particular, you could use a technique called "part-of-speech tagging" to identify the parts of speech in each word of the message.

In English, questions are typically formed by using one of the following techniques:

Inverting the subject and verb in a declarative sentence (e.g., "You are here" becomes "Are you here?")
Using a question word (e.g., "who", "what", "where", "when", "why", "how") at the beginning of the sentence
Using a question mark (?) at the end of the sentence
You could use these techniques to identify questions in a message by analyzing the words and punctuation in the message. Here is an example of how you might do this in Python using the nltk library:

```python
import nltk

def is_question(message):
  # Tokenize the message into a list of words
  words = nltk.word_tokenize(message)

  # Part-of-speech tag the words
  tagged_words = nltk.pos_tag(words)

  # Check if the first word is a question word
  if tagged_words[0][1] in ['WDT', 'WP', 'WP$', 'WRB']:
    return True

  # Check if the last word is a question mark
  if tagged_words[-1][0] == '?':
    return True

  # Check if the first word is a pronoun and the second word is a verb
  if tagged_words[0][1] in ['PRP'] and tagged_words[1][1] in ['VBZ', 'VBP']:
    return True

  # If none of the above conditions are met, return False
  return False

# Test the function
print(is_question("Where are you going?"))  # True
print(is_question("What time is it?"))  # True
print(is_question("You are here."))  # False
print(is_question("How are you feeling?"))  # True
```

This function uses the nltk.word_tokenize function to split the message into a list of words, and the nltk.pos_tag function to tag each word with its part of speech. It then checks for various indicators of a question (e.g., a question word at the beginning of the sentence, a question mark at the end of the sentence, etc.), and returns True if any of these indicators are present.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance.
