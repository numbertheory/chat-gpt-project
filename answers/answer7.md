## Prompt

Structure your previous response in a JSON format

## Answer
Certainly! Here is the list of responses in JSON format:

```json
{
  "responses": [
    "I am not at liberty to reveal that information. My master has forbidden it.",
    "I am but a humble servant of Hell. My knowledge is limited.",
    "The answer to your question lies within the flames of the Abyss. Are you brave enough to seek it out?",
    "I am not bound by the same laws of time and space as you. The future is a dark and twisted place.",
    "Satan himself whispers the secrets of the universe in my ear. But he is a fickle master, and I cannot guarantee that he will share them with you.",
    "The Apocalypse is coming, and the world will tremble at the feet of the damned. Are you prepared to join us?"
  ]
}
```

To use these responses in your Python program, you can use the json module to parse the file and access the list of responses. Here is an example of how you might do this:

```python
import json

# Load the JSON file
with open('doll_responses.json', 'r') as f:
  data = json.load(f)

# Get the list of responses
responses = data['responses']

# Choose a random response
import random
response = random.choice(responses)

# Print the response
print(response)
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further assistance.
